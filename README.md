# Haste Maps

Haste Maps lets you upload your maps and create your own GPS for RPG campaigns.

## How It Works

1. **Mark Intersections and Roads**: Identify intersections as nodes and roads as edges.
2. **Build the Map**: Once your map is built, use the shortest path button to find the best routes.
3. **Local Save**: The last map you made will be saved locally for easy access.

**Example:**

## Motivation

While playing the [Drakkenheim campaign](https://ghostfiregaming.com/dungeons-of-drakkenheim/) last weekend, I felt confused deciding our path during the journey. Since I was studying graph algorithms at the time, I thought, why not combine both?

## Technologies Used

This is a weekend project made using:

- [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The application runs on the client side and utilizes both TypeScript and JavaScript for some Cytoscape functionalities.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, execute the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.
